## Introduction

In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a me-taheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection. The goal of the project is to find the best solution to the Genetic problem.

## Background

In this project, we need to apply Genetic algorithm to find the best pattern.
In the processing of constructing “Evolution” model, we build the starting pattern and offspring, genotypes, expressions, and environment in the genetic algorithm. Then, we design the fitness calculation algorithm, the selection algorithm, the and the mutation algorithm Finally, we can get the best pattern.
